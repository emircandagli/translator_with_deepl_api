  "Email": "\nurgent mr . johnson obi, pacific bank plc , 9 th floor , ikoyi estatevictoria island , lagos . i am mr . johnson obi ,\nprovincial director pacific bank of nigeria , victoria island branch . i have an urgent and very confidential \nbusiness proposition for you. on sixth of june 2002, an american oil consultant / contractor with the nigeria \nmining corporation, mr . michael creek made a numbered time (fixed) deposit fortwelve calendar months, valued at us\n$ 20,200,000.00 (twenty million two hundred thousand dollars) in my branch . Unfortunately , i sent a routine \nnotification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we \ndiscovered thanks to his contract employers from the nigeria mining corporation that mr. michael creek died \nfrom an automobile accident. On further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will, \nand all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further \ninvestigation and discovered that mr. michael creek did not declare any kin or relations in all his official \ndocuments, including hisbank deposit paperwork in my bank. this sum ofus $20,200,000.00 is still sitting in \nmy bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sumat the end of each year. \nNo one will ever comeforward to claim it. According to nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, \nthe money will revert to the ownership of the nigeria government if nobody applies to claim the fund. \nConsequently, my proposal is that i will like you to stand in as the next of kin to mr. michael creek so that \nthe fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. \nThis is simple, i will ask you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney \nwill prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. \nWe shall employ the service of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the \nnecessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any \npart of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the \nbeneficiary / next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60 % for me \nand 40 % for you . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the \nattorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. \nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, \ni shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. \nPlease observe at most confidentiality, and restassured that this transaction would be most profitable for \nboth of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. \nSincerely,\nJohnson obi\n"

ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL   Dear Sir, I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchangeat the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc.  I am writing this letter to ask for your support andcooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.  Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim asthe next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund.  Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund. We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business. Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designatedbank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature.  I look forward to receiving your prompt response.   Mr. Kenneth Uba Union Bank of Nigeria. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork"

Six months ago, my shoe business \nwas on the brink of bankruptcy, and I had just one month before everything collapsed. I had nowhere to turn.\n\nFortunately, I met Michael through www.blessing-people.com, a non-profit website. When I shared my story, he \nstarted chanting for my business without asking for any money. To my amazement, within just 10 days, my business \nbegan to turn around. By the end of the month, I was able to pay my loan installment, and things steadily improved.\n\nGrateful for his help, I subscribed to his chanting services. The funds Michael collects are donated annually \nto those in need. I truly believe subscribing to his prayers has helped create good karma in my life. Now, I’m \neven looking for a second shop—something I never thought possible.\n\nI don’t know Michael personally, but I feel compelled to share his work as a way of giving back. What he does \nfeels miraculous, not just for me but for many others who have shared similar stories.\n\nI apologize if this email isn’t for you, but my intention is only to spread positivity and good karma.
