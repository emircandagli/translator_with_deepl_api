Despite our efforts, no next of kin has been identified in his official documentation, and all attempts to trace any family members have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe key issue is this: under the law, if these funds remain unclaimed for six years, they will automatically revert to government ownership. Given that the funds have already been dormant for five and a half years, time is of the essence. Without intervention, the money will inevitably fall into the hands of corrupt government officials.\n\nI am seeking your assistance to stand in as the next of kin, a role that requires a foreigner to ensure the release of the funds.

I am reaching out to you with a proposition that I believe will be mutually beneficial. I trust in your discretion and ability to assist me in this matter, and I kindly ask for your confidentiality.\n\nMy name is Bello Sankoh, the son of Mr. Foday Sankoh, who was arrested by the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone. Before his arrest, my father entrusted me with important documents related to a deposit he made with a security company in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. This deposit includes an iron box containing USD $22 million in cash, which was accumulated from the sale of gold and diamonds. My father intended to use these funds for our family's future investments.\n\nI traveled to Abidjan with the documents, confirmed the deposit, and have since been granted refugee status by the government of Côte d'Ivoire. My father instructed me to find a trustworthy foreign partner to assist in transferring this money out of Côte d'Ivoire for investment purposes.\n\nTo proceed, I kindly request your assistance with the following:\n\nProvide a secure bank account where this fund can be transferred, preferably in a location with minimal taxation.\nAssist me in obtaining travel documents so I can join you in your country to oversee the investments.\nIntroduce me to profitable business ventures in your country that do not require significant technical expertise.\nYour support in these areas is essential to ensure the success of this transaction and establish a strong partnership. As a gesture of gratitude, I am offering you 12% of the total funds upon successful completion of the transfer and investment.\n\nPlease note that the security and confidentiality of this matter are of the utmost importance. I trust you will handle this with the discretion it requires. I look forward to your urgent response so we can proceed without delay.\n\nThank you, and may God bless you.\n\nBest regards,\nBello Sankoh\nTel: +225 07 62 53 48\n"

        "Email": "\nSubject: Urgent Business Proposal\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am Mr. Johnson Obi, Provincial Director at Pacific Bank Plc, Victoria Island branch, Lagos. I am reaching out to discuss an urgent and highly confidential business opportunity with you.\n\nOn June 6, 2002, Mr. Michael Creek, an American oil consultant and contractor with the Nigeria Mining Corporation, made a fixed deposit of $20,200,000.00 (Twenty Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars) in our branch for a term of 12 months. Tragically, Mr. Creek passed away in an automobile accident, and our attempts to contact his next of kin have been unsuccessful. Investigations revealed that he did not declare any relatives or next of kin in his official documents, leaving the funds unclaimed.\n\nUnder Nigerian law, if the money remains unclaimed for five years, it will be forfeited to the government. To prevent this from happening, I propose that you stand as the next of kin to Mr. Creek. With your cooperation, we can ensure the funds are not lost to corrupt officials and instead are shared between us: 60% for me and 40% for you.\n\nHere’s how we proceed:\n\nYou provide your full name and address.\nI will engage two attorneys to draft and notarize the necessary documents to establish you as the legal beneficiary.\nThe funds will be transferred to a bank account you designate.\nRest assured, there is no risk to you. My position as branch manager, combined with the expertise of the attorneys, ensures the seamless execution of this transaction. Confidentiality is essential, and I trust you will handle this matter discreetly.\n\nIf you are interested, please respond promptly via the private email address provided below. Once I receive your reply, I will share additional details and documents to guide you through the process.\n\nThis opportunity has the potential to be highly beneficial for both of us. Additionally, I would appreciate your assistance in investing my share in your country.\n\nSincerely,\nJohnson Obi\n"
