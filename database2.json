My name is Mr. Kenneth Uba, and I am the manager of the Bills and Exchange department at the Foreign Remittance section of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. I am reaching out to seek your support and cooperation in executing a confidential business opportunity.\n\nOur department has discovered an abandoned account holding a sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty-One Million United States Dollars) belonging to a foreign customer who tragically passed away with his wife and two children in a plane crash in November 1997.\n\nSince his passing, no next-of-kin has come forward to claim the funds as stipulated by our banking guidelines. Without an heir, these funds are scheduled to be transferred to the bank's treasury as unclaimed funds.\n\nGiven this situation, my colleagues and I have devised a proposal: we would like to release these funds into your account, presenting you as the next-of-kin. This would allow the funds to be rightfully claimed without risk of discovery, as no other relative or entity is aware of the account’s existence.\n\nProposed Sharing Ratio:\n\n20%: For you, our trusted foreign partner.\n75%: For my colleagues and me.\n5%: To cover all expenses incurred during this transaction (local and international).\nOnce the transfer is complete, my colleague and I plan to travel to your country to manage our share, with the intention of investing in agricultural machinery for local development.\n\nTo initiate this process, we require your prompt response with the following details:\n\nFull Name\nPrivate Contact Telephone and Fax Numbers\nAddress\nDesignated Bank Coordinates\nThis information will enable us to file the necessary claims with the relevant authorities and secure approval for the fund transfer.\n\nPlease note, due to the sensitive nature of this transaction, it is imperative that this matter remains STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.\n\nI look forward to your swift reply and the opportunity to successfully collaborate on this venture.\n\nBest regards,\nMr. Kenneth Uba\nUnion Bank of Nigeria Plc\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n"

We are seeking your advice and assistance on how best to invest this money in your country. My father warned us against investing in Africa due to political and economic instability, as well as the risks associated with such transactions.\n\nIn exchange for your support, my mother and I have agreed to offer you 20% of the total amount as compensation. We possess all the necessary documents verifying the deposit and ownership, which I can share with you upon request.\n\nI must emphasize the importance of keeping this matter strictly confidential, as I have disclosed this information to no one but you.
